# Outflows_large-sample

we perform a large scale analysis of outflows in Cygnus X. We use the JCMT observations of $^{12}$CO(3-2) spectral line emission and implement linear regression model described in \citet{deb21} to estimate outflow properties. We also identified the associated protostars. We use a machine learning approach to fill out the missing information on protostellar luminosity using existing catalogs and investigate the comparative predictive powers of line emission and radio continuum data on local outflow formation. Finally, we show that the turbulent energy from single-generational outflows altogether can not provide enough energy support for the surrounding molecular clouds. 


These codes take observational values of outflow candidates as input variables (positions of blue-and redshifted pixels and velocity ranges) and generate visual maps and outflows properties as output (mass, momentum, energy)
