# Outflows_large-sample

The goal of this work is to investigate the interaction between cold molecular gas and stellar feedback in spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Particularly, the focus is on the Cygnus X region, a site for active star formation in the local arm (1.5 kpc from the Sun).   

Background: The evolution of cold molecular hydrogen gas clouds goes through several intermediate processes before spontaneous gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of pre-natal stars or protostars. Protostars are typically associated with wide angled, high-momentum molecular outflows. The energy injection from these outflows can provide significant amount of energy towards maintaining stability of the parent cloud, and influence further star formation. Also, the radition from existing young massive stars can induce gravitational collapse (like an induced labor) increse local star formation rate. 

There are four main results of this work,

1. Predicting mass, momentum, and energy of molecular outflows in Cyg X from 12CO(3-2) Spectral line emission data - 
  Typically, we need 3 separate spectral lines, namely, 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, for estimating these quantities. However, the last two are observationally expensive. Hence, we had developed an empirical model that can be used to infer these quantities from 12CO data alone. This was done by using all observatons available for a small sample of outflows. (Project link - ). 

2.  The role of outflows in turbulence support for host molecular clouds - 
  We find indication that outflows may be capable of reshaping their local environment, and influencing local star formation in their ambient clouds in Cygnus X. This influence is larger at smaller length scales and diminishes with increasing size of the ambient cloud. 


3. Outflow efficiency & handling missing data with machine learning - 
  Many of the outflows in our study were previously unknown, and their corresponding protostars are unidentified. We estimate the missing protostellar luminosity values using a supervised learning with imposed regularization. I find mechanical luminosity ~  1/1000 of Infrared Luminosity on average, which traces the accretion power. This is consistent with other studies (e.g., Wu et al. 2004). 

4. Triggering influence of local stellar feedback on protostar formation -
  Cygnus X being a site for many young stars and a rich deposit of molecular gas raises
the question whether there is evidence of triggered star formation in this region. I discussed such a specific case of potential triggering () In this
work I look into any potential association between radiative feedback and protostellar formation. Using Support Vector Machine I find there is support for triggering.
